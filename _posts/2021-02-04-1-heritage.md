My heritage is that of English and Scottish, Mum and Dad, respectively. Not so fun at Christmas when I get phone calls from Scotland (it can get very hard to understand the dialect). My English grandparents (pictured above) are an example of the traditional family. Married at 19 years old (1959), and are still married to this day, something of admiration. Nan looked after the house and 5 kids, whilst granddad was the breadwinner. My granddad was a network engineer after being in the RAF for 20+ years. During his time in the RAF, he was awarded a BEM (British Empire Medal) for his contributions. He left as rank of chief technician. 

The virtues that they have are to live by, and I confidently say I aspire to live a life like theirs.

I believe my passion for technology has come directly from that of my granddadâ€™s. Maybe it was the [Lego](http://jcoaten.com/2-lego.html) at Christmas, or the conversations we had about the future of space exploration or advancements in computers. Either way, I am thankful.
