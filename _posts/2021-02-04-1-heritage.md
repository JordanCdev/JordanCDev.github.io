My heritage is that of English and Scottish, mum and dad, respectively. Not so fun at Christmas when I get phone calls from Scotland (it can get very hard to understand the dialect). My English grandparents (pictured above) are an example of the traditional family. Married at 19 years old (1959), and still married to this day. Nan looking after the house with 5 kids, and granddad being the breadwinner. He was a RAF technician for 20+ years, during this time he was awarded with a BEM (British Empire Medal), and after became a network engineer. The virtues that they have are to live by. I confidently say I aspire to live a life like theirs. 

I believe my passion for technology has came directly from that of my granddadâ€™s. Maybe it was the <a href="http://jcoaten.com/2-lego.html">Lego</a> at Christmas. Or the conversations we had about the future of space exploration, or advancements in computers. Either way, I am thankful.
